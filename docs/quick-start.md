# Quick Start

MatterControl is an all-in-one desktop 3D printing software application created by MatterHackers, Inc. to organize and manage 3D prints. It features an intuitive approach to 3D printing, allowing users to queue multiple parts for printing without pre-slicing, preview and manipulate designs, as well as an integrated library which enables users to organize and search their design files.

## Connecting to a Printer
When opening the application you will see a grey bar at the top of the window. Select 'Connect to a Printer'. If you have connected to this printer before, you should be able to select it from the list in the pop-up window (which will disappear after selection), and it will appear in the grey bar of the application's screen. To complete the connection process, select 'Connect' in the top left corner.


Editing a printer: Step 1 (left) and 2 (right).
If you are unable to connect for any reason - ensure that your printer is turned on and connected, select 'Connect to a Printer', toggle edit mode, select the 'Edit' link next to your recently added printer, and double check the settings.

This will bring you to a page where you can edit the name, make, and model of the selected printer- similar to the same page where you first set up the printer. Under the section that says 'Serial Port': turn on the printer, take out the usb plug, and hit 'refresh'- you will see the USB port where it was become grey. Then plug it in, hit 'refresh', then select the port that became highlighted. Hit 'Save', then it will take you back to the screen where you select a printer. Select the printer, which will take you back to the main screen, then click 'Connect' in the top left corner.

Select the baud rate specific to your printer type. (TIP: 250000 is the most common and is set as the default. If you are unsure about your baud rate, trial and error can help you find the proper setting).

If it is not your first time connecting a printer, this will bring you to a list of printers that you have previously set up with the computer. Connect your printer via USB cable and turn it on. Select the printer you wish to connect to.
