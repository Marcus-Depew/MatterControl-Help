title: Printer Controls
---
MatterControl has a rich set of controls that you can use to manually control your printer's function and make adjustments during printing

You can find the manual controls on the far right after selecting and opening a printer.

Movement
--------

The Movement section of the Controls pane allows the user to manually move the printer nozzle(s), and extrude and retract filament when no print is active. This section also serves as fine movement adjustment during an active print.

The homing controls allow you to home one or all axes (move it to the starting position). The Release button disables power to the motors, allowing you to move the printer by hand. You can select how far you want the printer to move. The printers current coordinates are shown on the bottom. 

### Live Adjustment While Printing

While your printing is running you can use the Z+ and Z- buttons to adjus the height of the nozzle. This allows you to tune the height for a good first layer without having to restart the print. The current Z Offset is shown at the top of the Movement section. This is remembered for future prints. After printing, you can clear the Z offset by clicking the X.
